**StealThis.dev** is a curated open-source library of reusable web resources — animations, pages, UI components, and patterns — all free to copy and use.

## Browse the Library

Head to [stealthis.dev/library](https://stealthis.dev/library) to see all resources. You can filter by:

- **Category** — Web Animations, Web Pages, UI Components, Patterns
- **Difficulty** — Easy, Medium, Hard
- **Tech** — CSS, JS, React, GSAP, Intersection Observer, and more

## Copy a Snippet

<Steps>

1. Open a resource from the grid
2. Select your target (HTML, React, etc.) using the tab bar
3. Click **Copy** to copy the snippet to your clipboard
4. Paste it into your project

</Steps>

## View Full-Screen Demos

Resources that have a full-screen demo include an **Open in Lab** button. This opens the resource at `lab.stealthis.dev/[category]/[slug]` for an isolated, distraction-free view.

## Save Favorites

Click the ♥ icon on any resource card to save it to your favorites. Favorites are stored in your browser's localStorage — no account required.

To export your favorites list, go to the **Library** page and click **Export Favorites**. You can import them on another device.

## Use with AI Tools

Every resource page has an **Action Menu** with options to:

- **Copy Snippet** — copy the code for the current tab
- **Copy as Markdown** — copy the full resource documentation as Markdown
- **Open in ChatGPT** — copies to clipboard and opens ChatGPT
- **Open in Claude** — copies to clipboard and opens Claude
