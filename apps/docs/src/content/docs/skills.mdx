description: Claude Skills and Cursor Agent Skills for StealThis.dev — reusable AI workflows.
---

StealThis.dev includes **Skills** — reusable AI workflows that extend Claude and Cursor with project-specific knowledge and patterns.

## What are Skills?

Skills are YAML or Markdown files that define:

- **Instructions** — step-by-step guidance for the AI
- **Context** — project conventions, file patterns, naming
- **Examples** — sample inputs and expected outputs

They work with **Claude Code** (`.claude/skills/`), **Cursor** (`.cursor/skills/`), and similar agent frameworks.

## StealThis Skills

Resources in the `skills` category (e.g., [Git Commit Skill](https://stealthis.dev/r/git-commit-skill)) provide:

1. A ready-to-use skill file you can copy
2. Installation instructions (e.g., save to `~/.claude/skills/`)
3. Usage examples and integration tips

## Using a Skill

1. Open the resource page on stealthis.dev
2. Select the **YAML** or **Markdown** target
3. Click **Copy** to copy the snippet
4. Save to your skills directory (e.g., `~/.claude/skills/commit.yaml`)
5. The AI will use the skill when relevant to your request

## Creating Skills

To contribute a skill to StealThis, follow the [Resource Format](/resource-format/) spec and use the `skills` category. Include clear installation and usage instructions in the resource documentation.
