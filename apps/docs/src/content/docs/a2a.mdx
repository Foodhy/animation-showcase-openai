description: How StealThis.dev integrates with the Agent2Agent protocol for multi-agent workflows.
---

The **Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol** is an open standard that enables AI agents from different vendors to communicate, collaborate, and coordinate. StealThis.dev complements A2A through its **MCP server**.

## StealThis + A2A

| StealThis | A2A Concept |
|-----------|-------------|
| MCP server (`https://mcp.stealthis.dev/mcp`) | Tool/resource provider |
| `list_resources`, `get_snippet`, etc. | Capability discovery |
| Resource catalog | Structured data exchange |

## How It Works

1. **Agents** connect to `https://mcp.stealthis.dev/mcp` via MCP or HTTP
2. **Discovery** — agents call `list_resources` to browse animations, components, pages
3. **Retrieval** — `get_snippet` returns code for a given target (HTML, React, etc.)
4. **Integration** — agents use snippets in generated output (with attribution)

## Use Cases

- **Code-generating agents** — fetch UI components to include in user projects
- **Multi-agent builders** — one agent picks resources, another integrates them
- **Design-to-code pipelines** — match design intent to StealThis resources
